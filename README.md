# Control-Buzzer-Sound-for-Raspberry-Pi
Developed a simple GUI program in Python to control buzzer sounds by specifying the desired frequency for Raspberry Pi. The Python application communicates with a C++ program via shared memory and Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to manage pin control and generate a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal, enabling the buzzer to produce the required sound.
